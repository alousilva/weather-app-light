# Description
**Weather App Light** using node.js

This is my first attempt to code something using Node.js.

The Weather App Light is very simple and it is useful to understand how to call an API (in this particular case I'm using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api)) and write the response on the console.

# Usage

1) Add your own openweather api key
2) Launch the app just run this command:
```bash
npm run start
```

You can also provide the city as an optional argument:
```bash
npm run start porto
```
