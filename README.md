Weather App Light using node.js

Welcome to the **weather-app-light wiki**!

This is my first attempt to code something using Node.js.

The Weather App Light is very simple and it is useful to understand how to call an api (in this particular case I'm using the [Open Weather Map Api](https://openweathermap.org/api)) and write the response on the console.
